## Introduction

The Gemma model is a state-of-the-art language model designed for a variety of natural language processing tasks. By fine-tuning Gemma on the Dolly 15K dataset, we can enhance its performance on specific tasks that this dataset covers, including text generation, summarization, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.8.1 or higher
- Transformers library by Hugging Face
- CUDA (if using a GPU for training)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VKT2003/Fine-Tune-Gemma-Model-on-dolly-15k-dataset.git
    cd gemma-dolly15k-finetune
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dataset

The Dolly 15K dataset is a collection of text data designed for various NLP tasks. To use this dataset, download it from the source and place it in the `data/` directory:

1. Download the dataset:
    ```bash
    wget https://path-to-dataset/dolly-15k.zip
    unzip dolly-15k.zip -d data/
    ```

## Fine-Tuning

To fine-tune the Gemma model on the Dolly 15K dataset, run the following command:

```bash
python fine_tune.py --dataset data/dolly-15k --model gemma --output_dir models/gemma-dolly15k
```

### Fine-Tuning Parameters

- `--dataset`: Path to the Dolly 15K dataset.
- `--model`: Name or path of the pre-trained Gemma model.
- `--output_dir`: Directory where the fine-tuned model will be saved.

You can also customize other training parameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs in the `fine_tune.py` script.

## Evaluation

After fine-tuning, evaluate the model to ensure it meets the desired performance metrics. Run the evaluation script as follows:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model models/gemma-dolly15k --dataset data/dolly-15k
```

This script will generate performance metrics and compare the fine-tuned model against baseline results.

## Results

The results of the fine-tuning process, including training and evaluation metrics, will be saved in the `results/` directory. Key metrics to consider are accuracy, F1 score, and loss values.

## Usage

To use the fine-tuned Gemma model for inference, load it using the Transformers library:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("models/gemma-dolly15k")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("models/gemma-dolly15k")

input_text = "Your input text here"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(inputs.input_ids)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(generated_text)
```
